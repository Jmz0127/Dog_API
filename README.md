#Welcome to Dog_API, a simple CRUD App that renders a REST API. This database uses express, node, uuid (no two dogs will have the same id, similar to a veterinary system). On successful upload of a new dog, you will get a success message and unique Id generated.



#Post your doggy's info with the three parameters - dogsName: breedType: age: - with POST endpoint "/"
#Get pre-existing dogs with GET endpoint "/"
